Hello mr McWhorter,

First of all, the work you're doing on youtube is amazing. You have an amazing knowledge and ability to share it 


variables scope:

code timing for performance comparison (e.g. using the sort and average functions from one of the exercises)
Maybe together with evaluation of memory used through gc module? I haven't tried the last one though and I have very little experience working with garbage collector.
